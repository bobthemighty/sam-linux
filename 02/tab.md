Coooool... so now we can move around the directories, we can list files in a directory, and we can print files to screen.

We're getting somewhere.


Sometimes a file might have a really long name, and it would be boring and hard to type.

You can use the "tab" key to complete the names of files. It's the key just above caps-lock. Try it now, type `ls ` and hit the tab key. 

Now try typing `ls ~/` and hit the tab key, you should be able to cycle through options. Hit enter to choose an option, and you can keep on tabbing your way down.



Use tab-completion to cat the file in the 03 folder.
