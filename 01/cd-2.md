Well done!

You are now inside the directory /home/sam/01

This file is /home/sam/01/cd-2.md

To get back to where you were, you can type "cd .."

".." means "one level up". 

you can always get back to /home/sam by typing "cd ~". 

That funny squiggle is called a tilde. You can find it next to the enter key, on the same key as the hash.

In linux, ~ is short for "my home directory".

So this directory "/home/sam/01" can also be called "~/01".

"/home/sam" can also be called "/" and this file is ~/01/cd-2.md


Got all that? Try it now, type `cat ~/01/cd-2.md` and see that it is this file.

When you're happy with that, take a look inside the 02 folder, and cat the file that's in there.
