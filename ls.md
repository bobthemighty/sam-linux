ls is a tool that lists files on your computer.

It has a LOT of options that you can see in its man-pages (man ls).


Files on a linux computer are stored in "directories". Right now you're in a directory called '/home/sam'.

That's the place where you can store all your personal files. There are a bunch more directories already on this computer, that all have special jobs.

For now, type `ls` to see a list of all the files in this directory.

There is one file .md file you haven't read yet. Print it to the screen now.
