Woop! We're getting close, Sam.

For our next trick, we're going to install LXQT. 

`sudo pacman -S lxqt` then just hit enter when it asks you which bits you want to install (default (all)).

When that's done, you can type `startlxqt` to start your new desktop! When you're done moving the mouse around and feeling good about it all, just exit it by clicking the power button in the top right.
