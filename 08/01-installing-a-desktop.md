Okay, so `cowsay` is a pretty silly program but now we're going to install something more interesting: a desktop!

We're going to install a very simple, fast desktop called 'LXQT'. When you get the hang of things you can change this to whatever makes you happy.

Let's get started! We're going to need a few things, first. Each file in this directory tells you to install another piece of software and a little bit about what it does. You don't have to remember all of this, but DO REMEMBER that Linux, unlike Windows, is built from lots and lots of tiny pieces, and you can change or replace any of them.
