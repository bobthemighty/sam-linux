So sudo lets you do things that you can't normally do, like read this file.


What we're going to do next is:

 * Quickly learn how to use Vim to edit a file. Vim is kinda difficult to use, but it's very powerful, and it's on most Linux machines, so it's worth knowing.
 * Set up a wi-fi connection
 * Install a desktop environment
 * Install Google Chrome
 * Learn how to send secret messages that only we can read.

When you've managed to do all of that, we will use secret messages to set up some more challenges.
