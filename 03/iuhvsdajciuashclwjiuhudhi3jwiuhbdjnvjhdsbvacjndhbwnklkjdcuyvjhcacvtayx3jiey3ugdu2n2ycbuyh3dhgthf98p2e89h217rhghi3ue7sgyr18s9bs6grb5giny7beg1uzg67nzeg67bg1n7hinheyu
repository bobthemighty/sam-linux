Please tell me you didn't type out the name of this file!

We've finished the first part of your tutorial. Now you can navigate around folders, 
use ls and tab completion to see what is available, and use cat to read the content of files.

One last command before we start turning this machine into something a bit more useable.

`sudo` grants you super-powers. 

Right now you're logged in as "sam". Sam is a normal user, and is forbidden from doing things
that might break the computer.

There is special user on the computer called `root`. The root user is allowed to do *anything* 
he likes.

You can temporarily become the root user by using sudo. The 04 folder is locked, and only root can read it.

use `sudo ls ~/04` to see what files are in there, and then use sudo to cat the file that you find. 

If you try to read or edit a file that "sam" isn't allowed to touch, you'll get a 'permission denied' error. 

When that happens, you can use 'sudo' in front of your command, for example

```
bob@made-lt051:~|⇒  cat badgers.md 
cat: badgers.md: Permission denied

bob@made-lt051:~|⇒  sudo cat badgers.md 
This is the content of the badgers file.
```
