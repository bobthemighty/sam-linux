cd stands for "change directory".

When you typed ls, you should have seen three files ending in .md plus a bunch of other things called "01", "02", "03" etc.

Those are directories. You can see what's in those directories by typing "ls [name of directory]".

Try that out now.

To go inside a directory you can type "cd [name of directory]".

Go inside the 01 directory and cat the file that lives in there.
