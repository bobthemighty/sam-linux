Okay. At this point you know how to list files, move around the file system, install packages, and generally act like a Linux Boss.

It's time to learn Vim.

Vim is a text editor used by programmers and System Administors - I use it every day for writing code. It's *not* easy to use, but it is:

A) Very powerful
B) Installed on most Linux systems

To make sure it's installed, type `sudo pacman -S vim`. Once it's installed, try the tutorial by typing `vimtutor`


When you've completed the Vim tutorial, give me a call so I can give you a high five :D
