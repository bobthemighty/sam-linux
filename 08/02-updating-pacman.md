Firstly, we should update Arch to make sure we've got all the latest files. You should do this at least once a week. Unlike Windows, which has a new version every few years, Arch Linux updates every day so that you're always running the shiny new programs.

I try to update each day, so that each update is very small and I don't get a big surprise!

Type `pacman -Syu` to update the system.
