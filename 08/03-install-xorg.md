Xorg server is responsible for talking to your graphics card so that you can display pictures.

It's an old piece of software, but no good replacement is available. It's cool because lots of different applications can all talk to it to do graphics stuff. That's why you can choose lots of different desktops on Linux - they all just talk to xorg.

Some people like their desktop to work like a Mac, some people like it work like Windows, and some people - like me - want a crazy desktop that's great for programmers.

To install xorg, run `sudo pacman -S xorg-server`
